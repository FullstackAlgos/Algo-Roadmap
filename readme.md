# ALGO ROADMAP

Become an algorithm master with the help of Algo Roadmap! Do the thousands of question on leetcode, codewars, and other coding practice sites seem daunting? Do you ever feel lost and not know what to focus on? While these sites have amazing resources to help candidates prepare, it is tough to understand how to actually approach them and study. That's where Algo Roadmap steps in.

Algo Roadmap leverages leetcode questions to derive a curated roadmap based on simple principles. It wants the user to master a technique / data structure before progressing, focus only on the most effective questions, and ultimately have a clean and concise progress tracker. Additionally, one of Algo Roadmap's main values is community. So users are able to provide feedback for the administrators to flush out and integrate into the application. This way, Algo Roadmap will always be up-to-date with latest practice and opinions to ensure optimal learning for the entire community.
